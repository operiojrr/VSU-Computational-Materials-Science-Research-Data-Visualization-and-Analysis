# VSU Computational Materials Science: Research Data Visualization and Analysis

This repository contains Colab notebooks for visualizing and analyzing data generated from **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations, particularly using **Quantum ESPRESSO**. It is part of the work developed by the VSU Theoretical and Computational Research Group.

## Contents

- `DFTdav.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook for plotting and analyzing DFT data.

## Features

- Visualization of structural and electronic properties, including preliminary convergence plots
- Plotting utilities for band structure, density of states (DOS), and related properties.
- Data processing workflows suitable for quantum materials research.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- Common scientific libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`

## Usage

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/operiojrr/VSU-Computational-Materials-Science-Research-Data-Visualization-and-Analysis.git
2. Open the notebook (DFTdav.ipynb) in Google Colab and save a copy (do not use the main notebook; instead, use your copy).
3. Upload and then provide paths to your simulation output files.
4. Run the notebook cells to generate plots and analysis.
5. Edit depending pn your needs.

## Example Applications
 - Ecut and k-point convergence plots.
 - Lattice constants and Birch-Murnaghan EoS model fitting.
 - Band structure and DOS plotting.
